**iTunes Search App**
This is a search app that allows users to search audio and video media content from iTunes Store.
This app was made by Hawkin Spingies as an exercise to practice all of the topics covered so far covering express, Restful APIs, the 
Fetch API, React, and JavaScript.

*Setup & Installation*
Download the repository from github.
Open up the "explore_media" file in your IDE.
Open Terminal for both the backend and frontend folders.
Run "npm install" on both front and backend files to install all the project dependencies.
Run "npm start" in first the backend, then the frontend terminal to run the app on the local server.

*Security*
In order to secure security for this app, the Helmet module has been used (https://helmetjs.github.io/#get-started)

*Usage*
Once you have the app running, you can enter your desired search term and select the type of media from a dropdown menu ("All", "Movie"...) then click "Search".
The app will display up to 12 results that match your query. Each media item is displayed with its title, artist and image. 
There are two buttons on each media item that allow you to "Favorite" it or visit
